# Ad Revenue Prediction Using Regression Models

##  Project Overview
This project aims to build and evaluate multiple regression models to predict **advertisement revenue (`ad_revenue_usd`)** for online video content.  
The dataset contains video performance metrics, engagement indicators, and categorical attributes such as content category, device type, and country.

The goal is to identify the most effective regression model and understand the key drivers of ad revenue.

## Problem Statement
Predict the **ad revenue (USD)** generated by a video using historical data such as:
- Views, likes, comments
- Watch time and video length
- Subscriber count and engagement rate
- Content category, device, and country

---

## Dataset Description
**Rows:** ~120,000  
**Target Variable:** `ad_revenue_usd`

### Numerical Features
- views  
- likes  
- comments  
- watch_time_minutes  
- video_length_minutes  
- subscribers  
- engagement_rate  

### Categorical Features
- category  
- device  
- country

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key EDA steps included:
- Distribution analysis of numerical variables
- Correlation heatmap to identify relationships with ad revenue
- Boxplots to detect outliers
- Analysis of categorical feature impact on revenue

### Key Insights
- **Watch time** has the strongest correlation with ad revenue
- Engagement metrics (likes, engagement rate) indirectly influence revenue
- Outliers were found to be legitimate and retained

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Dropped non-informative columns (e.g., video_id)
- Extracted date-based features (year, month, day)
- Handled missing values (~5%) using **median imputation**
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables
- Used a **Pipeline** to prevent data leakage

---

##  Models Implemented
Five regression models were trained and evaluated:

1. Linear Regression  
2. Ridge Regression  
3. Lasso Regression  
4. ElasticNet Regression  
5. Huber Regressor  

Regularized models were used to handle **multicollinearity** among engagement features.

##  Model Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics were used:
- **R² Score** – explanatory power
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – average prediction error
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** – penalizes large errors
